# Playground2d
A simple 2D game engine made mostly for small simulations of various things I've seen on the internet or elsewhere. This project also includes simulations themselves.
Written in Java and based on LWJGL library.



## Boids

## Fireflies

## Gravity

![gravity](../media/gifs/gravity.gif?raw=true)



Simulation of a Newtonian gravity law.
Closer the objects, more attraction force there is. Higher the mass, higher the force.
