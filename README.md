My collection of random experiments and simulations using Java and LWJGL library.


## Evolutionary neural network projects

### Crumb eater

<img src="../media/gifs/eater1.webp" alt="crumb eater demo" width="320"/>

A robot "sees" crumbs in its environment through a vision system. The neural network receives input on the crumbs' locations, robot's orientation and distance from the play field center and current time. It outputs a rotation and speed value for the robot's movement. Performance is measured by the number of crumbs eaten within a time frame.

### Gravity

Simulation of a Newtonian gravity law.
Closer the objects, more attraction force there is. Higher the mass, higher the force.
